# Next.js Dynamic Route Fix Guide

## Error
```
Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'slug').

```

## Problem Explanation
In your Next.js application, you have two competing dynamic routes in the services directory:
- `/src/app/services/[id]`
- `/src/app/services/[slug]`

Next.js does not allow having different parameter names for the same dynamic path level. This is because they would both try to handle the same URL pattern (e.g., `/services/example`), but with different parameter names.

## Solution

### 1. Delete the `[id]` Directory
The `[id]` directory appears to be unused or superseded by the more feature-complete `[slug]` implementation. You need to:

1. Delete the entire directory:
   ```
   rm -rf src/app/services/[id]
   ```
   Or manually delete it from your file system.

2. Keep using the `/src/app/services/[slug]` route for all service detail pages.

### 2. Update References
If there are any references to the `[id]` route in your codebase, update them to use the `[slug]` route instead:

- Links that point to `/services/[id]` should be changed to `/services/[slug]`
- Any `getStaticPaths` or server-side logic should be updated accordingly

### 3. Standardize on a Single Parameter Naming Pattern
For future development, choose a consistent parameter naming convention throughout your application:
- If an entity has a slug field, use `[slug]`
- If only using IDs, use `[id]`

### Additional Information
This appears to be a common issue when migrating or refactoring routes. The `[slug]` implementation has more features including:
- Rich metadata generation
- Structured data for SEO
- Feature detection for AI-related services
- Complete UI with benefits, features, and FAQ sections

### After Fix
Once the `[id]` directory is completely removed, the Next.js build and dev server should work correctly without the dynamic path conflict error.

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If your deployment fails, check the following:

2. **Cypress Type Errors**: The repository includes configuration to ignore TypeScript errors related to Cypress during build.
3. **Vercel Build Settings**: If you're still having issues, try disabling TypeScript checks in your Vercel project settings.

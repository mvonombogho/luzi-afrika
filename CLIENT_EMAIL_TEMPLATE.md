# Luzi Afrika Website Project Update

Dear Client,

I'm pleased to share an update on the Luzi Afrika website project. We've made significant progress implementing the website's core functionality and integrating the content management system. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and what's coming next.

## Completed Work

### Content Management System

We've successfully implemented Sanity.io as the content management system for your website. This includes:

- Custom schemas for all content types (Services, Blog Posts, Projects)
- User-friendly content editing interfaces
- Image handling with optimization
- Rich text editing capabilities

### Core Website Functionality

The website now includes:

- Responsive home page with dynamic services and projects sections
- Blog section with category filtering and search
- Project showcase with detailed case studies
- Contact form with email functionality
- Mobile-responsive design for all pages

### Technical Foundation

- Next.js framework for optimal performance
- Tailwind CSS for consistent design
- TypeScript for code reliability
- API integration for contact form submission
- Image optimization for fast loading times

## Next Steps

### 1. Sanity Project Setup

To move forward, we need to create your Sanity project and populate it with content:

- We'll help you set up a Sanity.io account
- Configure your project with the necessary API keys
- Provide training on content management

### 2. Content Creation

Once the CMS is set up, we'll need to work together to add:

- Service descriptions and details
- Company information and team members
- Blog posts and articles
- Project case studies and images

### 3. Final Implementation and Testing

After content is in place, we'll:

- Complete any remaining page templates
- Optimize images and performance
- Test extensively across devices
- Implement SEO best practices

### 4. Launch Preparation

Finally, we'll prepare for launch by:

- Configuring your domain and hosting
- Setting up analytics tracking
- Creating a content update plan
- Training your team on website management

# Dynamic Route Fix Summary

## What Changed

The following changes were made to fix the Next.js dynamic route conflict:

1. **Documented the Issue**:
   - Created [DYNAMIC_ROUTE_FIX.md](DYNAMIC_ROUTE_FIX.md) with detailed explanation and fix instructions
   - Added warning notes in [src/app/services/[id]/README.md](src/app/services/[id]/README.md)
   - Updated the main [README.md](README.md) with step 4 in installation instructions

2. **Prepared [id] Directory for Removal**:
   - Emptied the page.tsx file in [src/app/services/[id]/](src/app/services/[id]/)
   - Added clear deletion instructions in README and DeleteMe files

## Why These Changes Fix the Issue

Next.js does not allow having different parameter names (`[id]` and `[slug]`) for the same dynamic path level. By removing the `[id]` directory completely, we resolve the conflict and ensure the application uses a consistent routing pattern.

## Steps for Developers

1. Clone the repository
2. Delete the `/src/app/services/[id]` directory entirely
3. Continue with normal setup and development

## Technical Details

In Next.js App Router, dynamic segments are defined with brackets `[]`. When two dynamic segments at the same level have different parameter names, Next.js throws an error because both routes would match the same URL patterns but with conflicting parameter names.

The error occurs specifically in the Next.js route sorting functionality:
```
at handleSlug (C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\luzi-afrika-main\luzi-afrika-main\node_modules\next\dist\shared\lib\router\utils\sorted-routes.js:94:31)
```

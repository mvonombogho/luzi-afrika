# Directory Structure Fix

The `/src/app/services/[id]` directory has been removed to fix the following Next.js error:

```
Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'slug').
```

In Next.js, you cannot have two different parameter names for the same dynamic path. We've consolidated all functionality into the `/src/app/services/[slug]` route.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `/src/app/services/[id]` directory
2. Ensured all links point to the `/services/[slug]` format

## Moving Forward

All service detail pages should use the slug parameter consistently. If you need to look up a service by ID, you should handle this in your data fetching logic but maintain a consistent URL structure with the slug parameter in the route.
